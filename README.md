## Luna CodeSnippet

This is the amended version of https://www.drupal.org/project/codesnippet

The differences are:

- The style is hardcoded as `dark`;
- The libraries are attached only when a codesnippet is actually available instead of every page;
- Removed JQuery dependency on FE as it's not needed at all;
